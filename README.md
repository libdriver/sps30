## LibDriver SPS30

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/sps30/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The SPS30 Particulate Matter (PM) sensor is a technological breakthrough in optical PM sensors. Its measurement principle is based on laser scattering and makes use of Sensirion’s innovative contamination-resistance technology. This technology, together with high-quality and long-lasting components, enables precise measurements from its first operation and throughout its lifetime of more than ten years. In addition, Sensirion’s advanced algorithms provide superior precision for different PM types and higher-resolution particle size binning, opening up new possibilities for the detection of different sorts of environmental dust and other particles. With dimensions of only 41 x 41 x 12 mm3, it is also the perfect solution for applications where size is of paramount importance, such as wall-mounted or compact air quality devices.

LibDriver SPS30 is a full-featured driver of SPS30 launched by LibDriver. It provides air quality reading, automatic cleaning configuration, ID reading and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver SPS30 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver SPS30 IIC,UART platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver SPS30 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver SPS30 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver SPS30 offline document.

/datasheet includes SPS30 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC,UART platform independent template and finish your platform IIC,UART driver. 

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.
